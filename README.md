# Flitter
A for-learning flutter framework.

## Why
because flutter code is hard to reason about (for me at least) so I'm making it.

## So can I use it?
You may if you're that crazy, but this is never going to be a ready-for-production framework. Maybe check Flutter for that ;P

## No testing, no documentation. How am I supposed to make use of this?
Again this is not meant for daily use. This is for people who want to learn how the flutter framework works internally.

I will be publishing a blog post explaining and building this same project. That will be the documentation.

**For now, stay tuned.**
